*Creating a Report in Power BI*

1. Data Transformation Using Power Query:
   - Import the ATM transaction data into Power BI.
   - Use Power Query to clean and transform the data, handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and merging tables.

2. Creating a Data Model:
   - Establish relationships between different tables (e.g., transaction details, customer demographics, ATM locations) to create a coherent data model.
   - Implement dimension modeling, creating fact and dimension tables for efficient data analysis.

3. Creating Measures Using DAX:
   - Write DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures to calculate key metrics such as average transaction amount, total transactions, and transaction counts by different customer segments.
   - Develop additional measures for specific insights like transaction patterns by time of day, week, or month.

4. Generating Data Insights Using Visualizations:
   - Create interactive charts and visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, to display key metrics and trends.
   - Design a dashboard that provides an overview of ATM usage, customer demographics, transaction types, and performance metrics.
   - Use slicers and filters to enable dynamic exploration of the data, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific insights.

By focusing on Power BI for data transformation, modeling, DAX measures, and insightful visualizations, the report will provide comprehensive insights into Wisabi Bank's ATM transaction data, supporting strategic decision-making and operational improvement
